FenceLife: 
This task pertains to the dynamic nature of the fence within the program. 
At any given time, a fence may randomly break down, transforming from a 'Fence' cell to a 'BrokenFence' cell. 
The repair of these damaged fences may occur spontaneously or be carried out by programmed entities known as Rangers.

ParasaurolophusLife: 
This task describes the life and behavior of the Parasaurolophus in the program. 
The Parasaurolophus roams around, consumes plants, and is obstructed by Water and Fence cells. 
It possesses a lethal threat to the Visitors, while itself being vulnerable to Rangers and Trex. 
When a Parasaurolophus encounters another of its kind, there's a 10% chance of them reproducing.

PlantLifeReturning: 
This task is centered on the regeneration of plant life in the program. 
Grass cells have a 50% chance to transform into Plant cells. Over time, Trunk cells will naturally revert back into Forest cells.

RangerProtects: This task is focused on the Rangers, who patrol only along the path cells. 
They mend BrokenFence cells, and are tasked with exterminating all dinosaur cells they come into contact with. 
Their movement pattern is limited to upwards and sideways, dictated by a random function.

Trex: The Trex task explains the behavior of the Trex within the program. 
It moves around and is restricted by Water and Fence cells. 
When a Trex encounters either a Brachiosaurus or Parasaurolophus, these dinosaurs transform into Grass cells. 
If a Trex comes into contact with a Ranger, the Trex is eliminated, and a new one is spawned.

Visitor: This task describes the Visitors' behavior in the program. 
Visitors traverse only along Path cells. If they come across a Brachiosaurus, Trex, or Parasaurolophus, these dinosaurs transform into Path cells. 
The Visitors' movement is limited to left, right, or upward directions.
